##Principles of Programming Languages

## Assignments Overview

This repository contains solutions to four assignments for the Principles of Programming Languages course. Each assignment focuses on different aspects of programming languages and involves tasks such as theoretical questions, implementation of functions in TypeScript, and extending the functionality of a type checking system.

### Assignment 1: Introduction to TypeScript
- **Topics Covered:** Basic TypeScript concepts, testing with Jest
- **Tasks:** Implement functions in TypeScript and write tests using Jest.
- **Folder:** `assignment1`
- **Files:**
  - `package.json`: Contains dependencies for the project.
  - `tsconfig.json`: Specifies TypeScript compiler options.
  - `src`: Contains TypeScript files to be implemented.
  - `test`: Contains test files.
- **Submission:** Zip file with `answers.pdf`, `part1`, and `part2` folders.

### Assignment 2: Asynchronous Programming with TypeScript
- **Topics Covered:** Asynchronous programming, promises, async/await
- **Tasks:** Implement asynchronous functions in TypeScript using promises and async/await.
- **Folder:** `assignment2`
- **Files:**
  - `package.json`: Contains dependencies for the project.
  - `tsconfig.json`: Specifies TypeScript compiler options.
  - `src`: Contains TypeScript files to be implemented.
- **Submission:** Zip file with `answers.pdf` and `part2` folder.

### Assignment 3: Functional Programming in TypeScript
- **Topics Covered:** Functional programming concepts, higher-order functions, currying
- **Tasks:** Implement functional programming concepts in TypeScript.
- **Folder:** `assignment3`
- **Files:**
  - `package.json`: Contains dependencies for the project.
  - `tsconfig.json`: Specifies TypeScript compiler options.
  - `src`: Contains TypeScript files to be implemented.
- **Submission:** Zip file with `answers.pdf`, `part1`, `part2`, and `part3` folders.

### Assignment 4: Type Checking System
- **Topics Covered:** Type checking system, type inference, type compatibility
- **Tasks:** Extend a type checking system in TypeScript to support new features and constructs.
- **Folder:** `assignment4`
- **Files:**
  - `src`: Contains TypeScript files to be implemented.
- **Submission:** Zip file with `answers.pdf`, `part2`, and `part3` folders.

Each assignment folder contains specific instructions, code templates, and test cases to guide the implementation process. The submissions are expected to adhere to the provided guidelines and folder structures to ensure smooth grading.


## Instructions

To access the assignments for each submodule, you can navigate to the respective submodule directories. Alternatively, you can clone this repository and initialize the submodules:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:roeylange/PPL.git
